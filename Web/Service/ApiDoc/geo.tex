\section{The geographical web service}

The system provides a geographical web service for managing the charting areas,
towns and counties known by the system. These are however to be set apriori
deployment, not to be changed after deployment, a feature were only ``ADMIN''
users have access and therefore are not documented. This is implemented in the
\svnweb{ro/ldir/ws/GeoWebService}{ro.ldir.ws.GeoWebService} web resource.

Documentation will be provided on a per ``need-to-know'' basis.
