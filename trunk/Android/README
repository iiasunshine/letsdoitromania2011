1. Google Maps API :

Beginning with the Android SDK release v1.0, you need to apply for a free Google Maps API key 
before you can integrate Google Maps into your Android application. To apply for a key, you 
need to follow the series of steps outlined below. You can also refer to Google's detailed 
documentation on the process at http://code.google.com/android/toolbox/apis/mapkey.html.

First, if you are testing the application on the Android emulator, locate the SDK debug 
certificate located in the default folder of "C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local 
Settings\Application Data\Android". The filename of the debug keystore is debug.keystore. 
For deploying to a real Android device, substitute the debug.keystore file with your own 
keystore file. In a future article I will discuss how you can generate your own keystore file.

For simplicity, copy this file (debug.keystore) to a folder in C:\ (for example, create 
a folder called "C:\Android").

Using the debug keystore, you need to extract its MD5 fingerprint using the Keytool.exe
application included with your JDK installation. This fingerprint is needed to apply for 
the free Google Maps key. You can usually find the Keytool.exe from the 
"C:\Program Files\Java\<JDK_version_number>\bin" folder.

Issue the following command to extract the MD5 fingerprint:
keytool.exe -list -alias androiddebugkey -keystore "C:\android\debug.keystore" -storepass 
android -keypass android

Copy the MD5 certificate fingerprint and navigate your web browser to:

to complete the application and obtain the Google Maps key.
